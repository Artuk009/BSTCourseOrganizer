# BSTCourseOrganizer

# Originally coded in C++ but later translated to Python because I wanted to know how it would look and ended up liking this version better #

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The academic advisors for ABC university desired a program that would output a course list for the students in alphanumeric order while using the most
memory and runtime efficient data structure. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand?
I approached the problem by first creating psuedcode for each of the possible data structures that could have been applied to the applicaiton (vector, hash table, and binary search tree) and calculated the runtime and space complexities of each. Then I compared the advantages and disadvantages of each and then decided that a Binary Search Tree would be the most efficient method for this particular program.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities for project?
I found many great resources online (i.e. Geeks for Geeks, stackoverflow, etc.) to help me tackle these methods that I wasn't too knowledgable of before this project.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Before this project, I had a vague understanding of how vectors, hash tables, bsts, and linked lists really worked. Now I know what nodes are for, different ways objects can be stored within nodes, and how nodes are given addresses to other nodes within a given data structure. Moving forward with application development, I will consider what data structure will accomplish a task using the least amount of memory and the shortest runtime for accomplishment of a given design requirment. 

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has enlightened me on the usefullness of utilizing pre-built data structures to expidite the process of writing new applications by filling out the 'boiler plate' portions of a program. The bst will always have a root node that is organized with the lesser number to the left and the greater number to the right, the hash table will always utilize key values, and the vector is always index dependent, etc. These data structures can be easily adapted to a wide variety of applications and will be recognizable to other programers who can adapt the code to other systems or change the code to facilitate new design requirments with relative ease.
